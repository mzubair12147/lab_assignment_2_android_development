The rise of digital distribution has resulted in a market flooded with a staggering number of titles, making it increasingly difficult for consumers to find games that match their interests and for developers to stand out. This challenge is multi-faceted and has several key components:\n" +

                    "Competing for Player Attention: With so many games vying for visibility, it’s challenging for quality titles to break through the noise and capture players’ attention. The overwhelming volume of new releases every week creates a situation where even the most innovative games can be easily overlooked.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Marketing and PR Challenges: Many indie developers, who often operate with limited budgets, lack the marketing and public relations expertise needed to gain visibility in such a crowded marketplace. Unlike major studios, these developers cannot afford extensive marketing campaigns or media coverage, putting them at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to promoting their games.\n" +

Algorithms are constrained by the finite nature of consumer attention, the limited hours in a day, and the disposable income available to spend on games. Moreover, algorithms often prioritize popular games with high engagement, which can further marginalize niche titles or indie games.\n" +

Over the years, developers have come up with various excellent co-op experiences that build a sense of solidarity between players, but not all co-op experiences are equal. Some games offer seamless co-op, others don’t. Some games are needlessly obscure about how to set up co-op.

Nioh 2 allows for three players to play all game missions together where beating bosses and levels in co-op transfers over to your single-player playthrough. Gunfire Games’ Remnant: From the Ashes and its sequel Remnant II are actually meant to be played in co-op mode, but the procedurally generated world prevents progress from carrying over to your single-player campaign. However, any level-ups, skills or items gained in co-op mode stay with you in single-player mode – you just have to finish the mission on your own again. "),

                    "From Demons’ Souls to Lords of the Fallen (and numerous indie gems in between), the souls-like game is a hotbed of innovation – and this is arguably the reason for their continued popularity. Like nature, the gaming industry is red in tooth and claw, and each studio must evolve to survive and thrive. The developers of souls-likes have taken this mantra to heart, always experimenting with a handful of core design principles, using them as a scaffolding to create entirely unique and punishing, but rewarding, games. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Open worlds have become larger and larger, but not necessarily better. In fact, Elden Ring arguably features the best open world, with elegant sightline design and even an immersive take on the infamous Ubisoft Tower. Its minimal design elements and UI let the player truly inhabit the Lands Between. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Perhaps this type of game draws successful and innovative studios precisely because they do not have to follow ‘souls-like commandments’ set in stone. There have been so many successful experiments on the souls-like that each one has its own identity: they might all follow a few rules, but the player will have no idea how they honour these rules. Even our own checklist is a descriptive rather than a prescriptive rule-set – if more developers decide to remove the infuriating slog back to where you died to recover lost resources, we would remove this death penalty from our rule-set.\n" +

                    "Souls-likes are heavily single-player focussed, but paradoxically, they also have the most inventive multiplayer systems.

                    "At its most basic, a souls-like features very difficult boss fights, inhospitable environments, unforgiving combat, preset checkpoints and various other elements meant to make the game hard but fair. A souls-like incorporates gameplay elements of developer From Software’s titles, like the Dark Souls trilogy, Demons’ Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and others – many of which were directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki. The souls-like is not a genre unto itself, but reinvents the fighting and RPG genres. This is why we study the shared traits of these games, rather than treating them as a subgenre.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "What are the Key Features of a Souls-Like?\n" +
                    "Fixed Difficulty: The player can’t change the difficulty level of these games. The entire user base has a level playing field. \n" +
                    "Unforgiving Combat: Just a few missteps will lead to player death. Combat moves such as attacks, blocks and dodges cost stamina (or a similar resource) and leave you vulnerable if completely depleted. Regular enemies are as strong as the player, if not more.\n" +
                    "Pattern Memorisation: The player must memorise enemy attack patterns and placement, and also the location of hazards or traps in order to succeed.\n" +
                    "Hostile Level Design: Navigating the environment is a challenge, with tough enemies packed in tricky locations. \n" +
                    "Preset Checkpoints: The player has to reach and activate checkpoints manually to use them, and will respawn there on death. The checkpoint is also a place to level up your skills. Activating a checkpoint respawns all enemies in the area except for bosses. \n" +
                    "Loose, Indirect Narrative: The games do not feature explicit cutscenes or plotlines. There may be a quest log, but no quest markers to guide the player to their objective. The narrative unfolds as the player explores the world, and uncovers its lore by talking to NPCs and slaying bosses. \n" +
                    "Penalty on Death: Players may lose unused items, XP and resources (called Souls in the Souls games and Runes in Elden Ring) on death, but they may be able to return to where they died to reclaim lost resources\n" +
                    "We class all souls-likes as ‘masocore’. As defined by game designer Anna Anthropy, a masocore game subverts the player’s expectations, and the genre conventions that they think they know. Souls-likes deliver a masochistic and hardcore experience that ultimately rewards the player with an immense sense of achievement after beating a challenge that appears to be insurmountable. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "True souls-likes batter and beguile you into thinking that failure is inevitable, when it isn’t. Death is central to learning from mistakes, and eventually defeating super-powered enemies. Both difficulty and deception play an equal role in a souls-like’s design as it constantly subverts the assumptions you make about the game.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Mastering combat, sussing out the game’s various illusory challenges and tricks, and eventually winning by paying attention can leave you immensely satisfied. This is probably why these games have a fervent fan base. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Souls-likes often explore dark fantasy themes. To paraphrase blogger Josh Bycer, in a souls-like, the world is ruined, the good guys are dead, there is nothing to save, and you are just trying to make things a little better (you will fail, however). You are not Geralt the White Wolf, the Dragonborn or John Shepard. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Bloodborne is a Lovecraftian horror fantasy. The Nioh games are filled with Yokai, monsters drawn from Japanese folklore. Demons’ Souls is set in a world overrun by soul-devouring creatures. The most prominent souls-likes are set in a carefully crafted and oppressive atmosphere that leaves no doubt that you are entering a world of pain. In that regard, there is no deceit. "),

This ‘genre muddle’ can handicap game makers, thwarting any attempt at informed game design because they lack a clear blueprint for the type of game they are making.

This is why we need not rely on marketing to determine that Immortals of Aveum (2023) is a first-person magic shooter; the shooter genre label already accounts for aiming magic projectiles. Even a platformer doesn’t need to be 2D: Sony’s Spider-man games have elements of the platformer – Spider-Man can swing past entire city blocks and land on various ‘platforms’ such as roof-tops and even window panes simply by web slinging. This approach to genre enables a game developer to envision shooters without guns, platformers without jumping, and simulations of impossible worlds where faster-than-light travel is a mundane reality. In essence, our genre definitions, by their very nature, inspire innovations. \n" +

There are other, similar types of manipulation, however: in Control (2019), the player character can manipulate in-game objects with telekinesis. This is tagged as ‘physics manipulation’. The developer can create their own unique spin on game world manipulation by studying such games. \n" +

The weird powers and items you can use seem to form an integral part of the eerie Federal Bureau of Control, which is tasked with containing and studying phenomena that violate the laws of reality. This close link between gameplay, tone and setting is reflected in our taxonomy. The developer can choose to make a game where the core mechanic and other elements are separate, or a game where the gameplay and other elements come together, and have a good chance of succeeding no matter what decision they take, because both Portal and Control are exhaustively analysed in the taxonomy. \n" +

                    "Our taxonomy is a classification system that has evolved over a decade, fine-tuned by our in-house experts. It allows you to understand every aspect of a game, from fundamentals, like genre, theme and gameplay mechanics to more subjective and nuanced elements such as its moods and vibes. It was built by tearing down games and identifying various elements, big and small, to see what made each game work, what features they possessed and how they emphasised or played down elements to create a distinctive gaming experience. In essence, it tells you what features a game has, and how prevalent any feature is in the game. Simply put, the taxonomy of a game is like its recipe.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Identify & Quantify: The Foundation of our Taxonomy\n" +
                    "Most forms of entertainment, like film, television, music and fiction are passively consumed, and have been extensively classified based on the genre, the creator of the artwork, and other relatively stable groupings, especially as these forms of entertainment have matured over the course of decades and even centuries. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Classifying games presents a unique challenge because interactivity is fundamental to gaming. This means that what you will be doing, how important it is over the course of the game, and how often you will be doing it need to be considered if one wants to see what makes a game tick. A game classified without quantification will say little about the full make-up of the game. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "That is why the four-value system is the lynchpin of our game taxonomy. It assesses the significance, prevalence and frequency of the various features of each game, creating a full picture of what to expect in any given playthrough, and how each game offers a distinct and unique gaming experience, with its own mix of interactions and features. Below, we discuss each of the four values that can be attached to a game’s features,  in detail. \n" +

In a first-person shooter like a Halo game, you will almost always be shooting your way through enemies, from a first-person perspective. In a role-playing game, which offers multiple viable playstyles (including shooting, fighting, magic etc), the descriptive genre of ‘Role Playing’ is the defining feature, and every single possible playstyle or build becomes a ‘key’ feature, discussed below. \n" +

                    "These refer to actions or activities that you may be performing most of the time, and features present in much of the game. They often distinguish games of the same genre from another. Halo has a great deal of vehicular combat and lets you drive and fly vehicles, whereas a Call of Duty game does not emphasise vehicular activities as much. Those who love the vehicle sequences in Halo may not find much use for a CoD title. \n" +

                    "These are actions or activities you will be performing some of the time, but are nevertheless required to progress through or finish a game’s campaign, and can also refer to features that form an important, if limited, part of the game. For example, boat traversal is the only means of going from one place to another in the God of War series and the game can’t be completed without using the boat. Some levels of certain games can feature locked off areas accessible only by exploring further. \n" +

Some games have a single mandatory escort mission, and these count as elements because they form a very small part of the campaign. Cooking in Skyrim is entirely optional – you can cook food that improves your vital stats but potions do the job much better, and making potions (alchemy) is in fact an important part of the game, with its own skill tree.

Game AI has evolved from the simple computer operated opponents in Pong and early arcade games to increasingly complex NPC agents in games such as RDR 2, the Halo franchise and Bethesda’s Elder Scrolls games. Developers have contributed significantly to defining, and redefining game AI, and games such as RDR 2 have pushed game AI to the limits, creating NPCs so convincing that they seem to have a life of their own.\n" +

                    "\n" +
                    "AI has been integral to gaming from the arcade age – AI opponents became prominent during this period with the introduction of difficulty scaling, discernible enemy movement patterns and the triggering of in-game events based on the player’s input. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Game AI is distinct from the sort of AI we have become familiar with today, which is powered by machine learning and uses artificial neural networks. A key reason why in-game AI has remained distinct from today’s AI constructs is that game AI needs to be predictable to some degree. A deep learning AI can rapidly become unpredictable as it learns and evolves, whereas game AI should be controlled by algorithms that give the player a clear sense of how to interact with NPCs to achieve their in-game goals.  \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "According to Tanya Short, game designer and co-founder of KitFox Games, game AI is to some extent “smoke and mirrors” – complex enough to make players think they are interacting with a responsive intelligence that is nevertheless controlled and predictable so that gameplay doesn’t go awry. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Within this relatively narrow scope, however, in-game AI can be quite complex, and game developers expertly fake the illusion of intelligence with various clever tricks – some developers have even experimented with giving more freedom to game AI, leading to interesting and unforeseen results. \n" +

Stored patterns for this game randomised alien movements, so that each new game had the potential to be different. In Pac-Man (1980), the ghosts’ distinct movement patterns made players think they had unique traits, and made them feel they were up against four distinct entities. \n" +

                    "The answer to this problem is the pathfinding algorithm, which directs NPCs through the shortest and most efficient path between two parts of the game world. The game map itself is turned into a machine-readable scene graph with waypoints, the best route is calculated, and NPCs are set along this path. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Such an algorithm is particularly important and prevalent in real-time strategy (RTS) games, where player-controlled units need pathfinding to follow commands, and enemy-controlled units need the algorithm to respond to the player.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Early pathfinding algorithms used in games such as StarCraft (1998) ran into a problem – each single unit lined up and took the same path, slowing down the movement of the entire cohort. Many games then used various methods to solve this problem – Age of Empires (1997) simply turned the cohorts into an actual formation to navigate the best route, and StarCraft II (2010) used ‘flocking’ movement, or ‘swarming’, an algorithm devised by AI pioneer Craig Reynolds in 1986. Flocking simulates the movement of real-life groups such as flocks of birds, human crowds moving through a city, military units and even schools of fish in water bodies. \n" +

                    "Finite state machines (FSM) are algorithms that determine how NPCs react to various player actions and environmental contexts. At its simplest a finite state machine defines various ‘states’ for the NPC AI to inhabit, based on in-game events. NPCs can transition from one state to another based on the context and act accordingly. If the NPC is designed to be hostile to the player character, seeing the player may lead it to run toward them and attack them. Defeating this NPC may impel it to run away, to go into a submissive mode, or simply enter the death state (i.e., die).\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "In fact, FSMs can ‘tell’ an NPC to ‘hunt’ players based on cues like audible or visible disturbances to the environment – this is a staple of stealth games, and the Metal Gear Solid franchise has used the hunting mechanic to create tense situations between the player and the NPC. Finite-state machines can also tell NPCs how to survive – under attack, they can take cover to improve health levels, reload ammunition or search for more weapons, and generally take action to evade death at the player’s hands.

For this question, any one of the responses can serve as a deal breaker – customers who cite multiple factors do not mean they will put up with some, but not all, of the problematic aspects of a game. They will abandon a game if it has even one of the features that displease them, and our sentiment analysis can help gauge user attitudes about a game’s monetization strategy, its performance, user experiences with a game’s multiplayer base, and even perceptions about whether the game delivers value for money. \n" +

                    "Players younger than 25 – who form a significant chunk of our survey population – are 15% more likely to tolerate aggressive monetization, though cost plays a greater role in their buying decisions (around 35% vs the average of 30%). Younger players want to be convinced of the value a game offers before parting with their money, and the freemium/free-to-play, or live-service game model is ideally suited to their preferences – they can assess the free base game and decide whether premium content will be worth the price, and can also satisfy their need for social engagement through such games. \n" +

The average gamer is around 35-37 years old, and a significant chunk of gamers today are in their late thirties or early forties. They have more disposable income to spend on games, and are more likely to spend frequently on gaming. Such players almost certainly got their first taste of gaming from the third and fourth generation of consoles and their nostalgia for this time period impels them to seek out the games of the ’80s and ’90s. \n" +

The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) saved the industry after the video game crash of 1983 and introduced instant classics such as Super Mario Bros (1985) and The Legend of Zelda (1986), both of which would spawn long-running game franchises. The quality of these games has made retro gaming a highly enjoyable pastime – and the NES and SNES are especially popular among retro gamers. The shift from 2D to 3D, during the fifth generation, marked the end of an era that had brought gaming back to the mainstream. This may be why many indie titles, including the ones we discuss in this blog, pay homage to this time period in gaming history. \n" +

                    "Every 3D model (or mesh) in a game is composed of triangles, and will have generally gone through several iterations of optimisation to reduce its ‘polycount’, i.e, the number of triangles (or polygons) it has. During the design stage, however, high-poly models, containing lots of details, are created using 3D design tools such as Max, Maya, ZBrush and others. Such high-res models can contain more than a million polygons and simply cannot be deployed in-game – the renderer would choke – but their details are required to make a scene believable. This is where normal mapping comes in – through a process known as baking, the detail of a high-res model is transferred to a ‘map’ (short for bitmap), or texture, which the game engine can use to give an optimised model the illusion of detail. Such normal maps can also convincingly mimic how the high-polygon model would respond to lighting, furthering the illusion that you are seeing a detailed in-game object, and not an optimised mesh linked to a normal map. The key benefit of a normal map is not just that it creates the impression of detail, but also that it creates this with highly-optimised, game-ready geometry. \n" +

A custom-made version of this card was used in Microsoft’s first Xbox, which used normal mapping extensively. The PS2 didn’t include support for such texture-mapping, but by the seventh generation of consoles, normal mapping was the norm across PCs and consoles. \n" +

This comes from a variety of segments within gaming, which we’ve covered in detail in our game monetisation article. Long gone are the days when game revenue came from physical or even digital sales of copies. These days, subscription services, in-app purchases (IAPs), and advertising all contribute just as much, if not more, to revenue. \n" +

In 2019, a survey conducted by deltaDNA found that 94% of free-to-play video game developers incorporate some form of in-game advertising. Knowing these facts, we’re going to zoom in on one particular sector here, which is advertising in games.\n" +
                    "\n" +

                    "\n" +
                    "The History of Advertisements in Gaming\n" +
                    "From the above data, the question arises, how did game makers realise the potential of generating revenue through advertising? The first ever ad in-game was actually not a commercial one, but that of a game developer trying to generate interest for his next game. Scott Adams, the creator of Adventureland left a message promoting his next game, Pirate Adventure.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Scott Adams created hype for his next game through his first, Pirate Adventure.\n" +
                    "After this (relatively) wholesome ad though, game devs and brands alike took a note from movies and TV shows. They saw how the latter did product placement and wanted to replicate it in games but they faced some hurdles. In movies and shows, you can see the world in great detail so including a product or two doesn’t look odd. A character casually drinking Coca Cola or lacing up their Nike shoes doesn’t affect the quality of the production. In games however, the graphics then weren’t great enough to include most products organically. Thus, the gaming industry came up with another way to partner with brands and those were advergames. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Advergames are games made exclusively for advertising purposes. The first released advergame was Tapper in 1983.  The game had been originally sponsored by brewer Anheuser-Busch, and featured the brand’s logo with gameplay based on serving beer. The game proved so popular that a non-branded version of the game, Root Beer Tapper, was released for general arcades, with the beer replaced by root beer to cater to younger audiences. In the 80s and 90s, numerous advergames were released (though the term only came into existence in 1999) and with graphics improving significantly, new advergaming opportunities appeared. For instance, car manufacturers couldn’t really show off their cars in games until graphics improved enough by the 90s and games like Driver and Need for Speed really took off (though they didn’t show these vehicles being damaged even if you were an awful driver because bad for business, but we digress.)\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "While ads these days in games are mostly annoying, back then, a lot of the released advergames were actually quite popular and… fun. Chex Quest, a cereal-themed child-friendly remake of Doom, was a huge hit and is till date, considered one of the best advergames made. Advertisers also experimented with different kinds of product placements. They had ads integrated into splash screens (McVities Penguin Chocolates in James Pond Robocod, 1991), they made their mascots characters in-game to avoid directly mentioning their products (Ronald McDonald starring in McDonald’s Treasure Land Adventures, 1993), and they even weren’t below taking potshots at their competition. The latter in particular was interesting: Coca Cola worked with Atari to redesign their mega-hit Space Invaders for one of Coca Cola’s sales conventions. The aliens you had to shoot would spell out ‘Pepsi’ on the screen. A rather on the nose shot. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Chex Quest was one of the most popular Doom remakes released.\n" +
                    "In 1999 though, Crazy Taxi rewrote the classic advergame template, where the brand was no longer the center of the game but instead, just a facet. In the game, you’re a taxi driver picking up a passenger and taking them to where they want to go, which are places like Levi’s store or Pizza Hut. You could also see other brands and stores enroute, and the placement of all of these were organic enough for gamers to appreciate the realism. A case of where art imitates life (a tad ironically) arose in games like Madden, NFL, and FIFA. They all had to pay licensing fees to incorporate details from the real-life leagues and to offset these, they started getting into sponsorship deals with brands to show them prominently in-game. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "In 2005, a game called Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory used what we call now as ‘dynamic advertising’ where the ads shown were relevant to players. This audience segmentation, as it is known, was first done by Splinter Cell’s developers Ubisoft, though the industry followed suit soon.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Of course, if you’re going to be overly heavy handed with in-game product placement, especially if it doesn’t make sense in the game universe, your audience isn’t going to be very happy about it. EA found this out to their chagrin when their billboards for Pepsi and Intel in Battlefield 2142, a game supposedly set a century in the future, were disliked strongly by players. To give them their due, they did eventually remove the ads from the game but it was one of the first games where the negative side of putting ads in your game really showed up. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "When mobile gaming started to take off, it led to a change in game design and how games were monetized. Games were now often F2P with their main revenue coming in from ads. We’ve covered how exactly mobile games are monetized in our article about them if you want the details, but a lot of different kinds of ads began being made and incorporated into games. We’ll head into the different types of ads in a later section but suffice to say, ads in games were here to stay. However, not all game developers took care that these ads were ok with their customers. Often, mobile games have the issue of showing too many ads. You clear a level? Ad. Lose a life? Ad. Open the app? Ad. This sort of nagging by a game would be bad enough but since a lot these games derive most if not all of their revenue from ads, they feel the need to make levels shorter and squeeze in as many adverts as possible to maximise revenue, to an extent sometimes where games become almost unplayable. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Finally, both AR and VR have also started seeing the potential of ads to generate revenue. In Pokemon Go, Niantic added advertising which showed up depending on which location you were at, bringing the real and virtual world together. While there are no conventional banner ads in Pokemon Go, they still have sponsored Poke Stops, free items in-game from companies that support the game which you can claim by looking at an ad, and even some sponsored cosmetics but so far, all of these have not messed with the game’s immersion. On the VR side of things, Volvo made an app that uses VR glasses to test drive their XC90 SUV. In fact, by 2022,  the number of annual installs of AR and VR apps will grow by 45% compared to 2017, and the market for in-app purchases will increase by 92%.\n" +

                    "The Types of In-Game Advertising\n" +
                    "We can see from our history of game advertising that there are several ways of placing products in-game. Different methods of advertising work for various products, game devices, or even game genres, and especially with mobile game ads, a lot of variety has popped up. Let’s look at the major types.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Static Advertising/Product Placement:\n" +
                    "Static in-game advertising is when ads are coded right into the game and can’t be changed (unless the game is completely online.) These advertisements are planned and integrated into a video game during the design/development stage, and as such, can be integrated in a customised manner. For example, Splinter Cell used in-game Sony Ericsson phones to catch terrorists. Unlike conventional static advertising in real life, static ads in game allow players to interact with the product being advertised. Ads are also incorporated on billboards, especially in sports games, analogous to how it happens in reality.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Advergames:\n" +
                    "These are custom-made games which are built for promoting a particular product or brand through its story, environment, or gameplay. Advergames can also offer players benefits in real life through coupons, discounts, and the like. These games are a fun and entertaining way for brands to connect with their customers if done right.\n" +
                    "Examples of great advergames include Cool Spot from 7up, Sneak King by Burger King – this led to a 40% increase in sales revenue for Burger King, McDonald’s Treasure Land, and Pepsiman by, well, Pepsi.\n" +
                    "Dynamic In-Game Advertising\n" +
                    "Dynamic advertisements are those which consider various factors such as location, age, personal interests, and more before displaying ads. These are personalised ads at scale and using dynamic ads, any brand can segment people who use their app or website and show them products and services they have a keen interest in. They allow game developers/publishers or the ad delivery service to track their ads in real-time and get data such as angle from which the ad is viewed, screen-time spent, and more to correct issues and improve existing and future ads.\n" +
                    "There are various kinds of dynamic ads, some of which include:\n" +
                    "Diegetic dynamic ads: These are dynamic ads which are seamlessly placed in the video game world. This allows media buyers to purchase real-time and geo-targeting capable advertising inside of video games. The adverts appear inside the game environment, on virtual objects such as billboards, posters, and bus stops – all of which are objects that you’d expect to see in a realistic sports or urban environment video game. Tony Hawk: Ride is an example.\n" +
                    "Interstitial ads: According to Google, interstitial ads are full-screen ads that cover the interface of their host app. They’re typically displayed at natural transition points in the flow of an app, such as between activities or during the pause between levels in a game. When an app shows an interstitial ad, the user has the choice to either tap on the ad and continue to its destination or close it and return to the app, though often, games force users to sit through several seconds of the ad which can be quite frustrating. Video ads are a popular kind of interstitial ad in games.\n" +
                    "Banner Ads: These are advertisements present in the form of banners in the game. They may be displayed at different positions like the top, bottom, or side of the screen. They may occur at different instances in the game such as in the main menu, during gameplay, between levels, and more.\n" +
                    "Reward ads: These are ads which are basically an in-game exchange offer: users view ads for in-game rewards like extra lives, boosters, and the like. Candy Crush is a good example of a game with good reward ads. Since these ads are optional and users can choose to avoid them, they aren’t as negatively looked at and they even increase in-app purchases. However, unlike interstitial video ads, some of these are not skippable.\n" +
                    "Playable ads: These are mini games users can try out and if they like it, they can install the complete app. They make for a great user experience and have some of the best conversion rates. Tennis Clash and Royal Match both are popular playable ads.\n" +
                    " Offerwall ads: These tend to list out tasks that users can complete in exchange for in-game rewards. They act almost like a mini online store and since they’re optional, they aren’t frowned upon as much as ad barrages. They also increase time spent on apps significantly by extending the session length.\n" +
                    "Through-the-Line Advertising\n" +
                    "This is a kind of advertising that involves the use of URL hyperlinks within the game to get players to visit web-pages with advertisements. The technique used to tempt the player into visiting the intended URL varies from game to game.\n" +
                    "In games such as Enter the Matrix, Year Zero, I Love Bees, and Lost Experience, URLs make up a part of the background of the game such that certain plot details can only be learned by following the link."),

They also allow games to be deployed on multiple platforms – game engines are capable of platform abstraction. Both Unity and Unreal Engine support easy deployment of game-ready assets from their respective marketplaces, the Unity Asset Store and the Unreal Marketplace.\n" +

By providing support out of the box for developing many aspects of a game, engines reduce cost, time and manpower investment, allowing game studios to remain competitive in a constantly-evolving industry in which production costs have steadily risen. They also foster innovation by making game development easier. \n" +

                    "History of Game Engines\n" +
                    "Strictly speaking, game engines did not exist prior to the ’90s. Before the advent of such software applications, games had to be designed from the ground up, and very little of the code base could be reused when deploying games on multiple platforms. Games for the Atari 2600 – a major game console released in the ’70s – were coded using assembly language specific to the console. Developers did reuse code, but there was no unified code base that could be extended to create multiple Atari 2600 games. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Super Mario Bros (1985) is arguably the first console game to be made by reusing a critical piece of code – Shigeru Miyamoto’s team had written the code to enable smooth side scrolling for their 2D racing game Excitebike (1984), and their code was reused in the making of the first Super Mario Bros game, allowing Mario to smoothly move across the screen and even accelerate from a walk to a run. This was an important inflection point in game development, considering that much of the first Mario game had to be designed by hand, on graph paper, and the platform for which it was built, the Nintendo Entertainment System, used assembly language, limiting code reuse. Despite this, the developers managed to re-implement the Excitebike code for the Mario game.\n" +

                    "The ’80s also saw the release of several 2D game development kits – known as game creation systems – that enabled users to create specific games using pre-built assets: the Pinball Construction Set (1983), the Adventure Construction Set (1984) and the Shoot-‘Em-Up Construction Kit (1987) are examples of kits published during this time. Each kit was specialised for a specific type of game – users made pinball games with the Pinball Construction set, while the Shoot-Em-Up kit enabled the creation of 2D shooters.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Pinball Construction Set (Courtesy Electronic Arts)\n" +
                    "These kits allowed everyday users to create games using existing components, and often featured a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that further eased the process of creating a game. The Shoot-Em-Up kit even allowed users to share their creations as full game files, which could then be played on other systems that did not have the construction kit itself. No coding knowledge was required to make these games – this helped popularise such kits, but also limited the scope of the games that could be made with them.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Garry Kitchen’s GameMaker (1985), released by Activision for various home computer systems, was the first integrated development environment for making games, and can be considered a proto-game engine. GameMaker allowed users to create background graphics, movable objects known as sprites, sound effects and in-game music, and also included a game programming language that allowed the developer to code more features. GameMaker’s versatile programming language set it far apart from other game creation systems of the time.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The first game engine as we understand the term today was not the Doom engine, but an earlier code base created by id for the production of a new game trilogy for their Commander Keen franchise. From the outset, id recognised that creating a single piece of software that provided common functionality for multiple games was a more significant accomplishment than making a game, and even tried to license the so-called ‘Keen engine’ (1991), but met with little success. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The reason why this software was called a game engine is largely because both John Carmack and John Romero of id are car enthusiasts. According to Romero, an engine is the heart of the car, while the game engine is the heart of the game – it powers the game, while the art and other game assets are comparable to the body of the car. After coining the term, id introduced it to the world with the Doom press release in 1993. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The developer found a much more receptive audience for the Doom engine – after all, it had powered a massive hit, and was hence licensed by several companies, leading to the release of games such as Heretic (1994), Hexen: Beyond Heretic (1995) and Strife: Quest for the Sigil (1996). Developers using the Doom engine added their own graphics, characters, weapons and levels—the “game content” or “game assets” were unique to the developer, but the technology that powered the game was id’s engine.\n" +

                    "Heretic (Courtesy GT Interactive)\n" +
                    "The engine itself was revolutionary in many ways – it faked a 3D experience by adding height differences to the environment and used only 2D sprites. Even now, Doom is remembered for how fast-paced it was, but the original renderer Carmack wrote slowed to a crawl on most systems when rendering complex scenes. Carmack then researched academic papers and implemented a technique known as binary space partitioning – never used before in a game – to dramatically speed up the Doom engine’s renderer. In drastically simplified terms, binary space partitioning enabled the engine to prioritise the rendering of objects based on how close they were to the player, and ‘cull’ or not render areas that were hidden or too far away from the player, thereby shortening render times. This enabled Doom to be very responsive and run at high frame rates on the home computers of that time, without sacrificing graphical fidelity. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "A few years after Doom, Carmack observed that the engine technology was id’s key value proposition and that game designing (on top of such engines) could well be managed by ‘a few reasonably clued-in players’. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Ken Silverman took cues from Doom to create the Build (1995) engine at the age of 19. The Build engine refined the illusion of 3D with the ability to look up and down in games such as Duke Nukem 3D (1996), even though these titles were rendered, like Doom, on a 2D plane. Silverman also added tags to parts of the game world – walking over or into these areas would teleport the player, creating the impression of falling down a pit or passing through a tunnel.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Soon after Doom, id released the Quake engine (1996), which featured true 3D real-time rendering and support for 3D hardware acceleration. The engine also used a dynamic shader for moving objects and a static lightmap for stationary bodies. Quake (1996), which was made with the engine, is yet another milestone in gaming.\n" +

                    "Bethesda had earlier attempted a true 3D engine of its own, called XnGine (1995), which suffered from bugs and stability issues. Eventually, Bethesda achieved success with the engine by creating the huge, procedurally-generated world of The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall (1996), but would eventually abandon XnGine for NetImmerse (1997), the predecessor to Gamebryo. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The developers at id then outdid themselves with id Tech 3 (1998), an upgraded version of the Quake engine that would later power games such as Medal of Honor: Allied Assault (2002) and Call of Duty (2003), and would be licensed to several developers. The engine was simply called the Quake III Arena engine, the game for which id had upgraded their original code base. It featured next-gen graphics using shaders – scripts that determined – and enhanced – the appearance of many in-game objects, surfaces, areas and even character models with accurate shadows, light emission and reflections. Shader code also specified the sound effect associated with a surface, and was also used to identify map sections such as water bodies. The engine was one of the first to allow for curved surface geometry as well. All these innovations – especially the shader system – were computationally expensive and would have crippled the engine’s renderer, which is why the developers implemented the now legendary fast inverse square root algorithm. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The fast inverse square root algorithm quadrupled the speed of calculations for pathfinding, lighting, reflections, and many other game-critical operations. In effect, Quake III Arena (1999) boasted far better performance – with high quality, hardware accelerated graphics – because a piece of code less than 20 lines long sped up calculations performed millions of times per second in games. When id released the source code for the engine in 2005, the code fragment attracted the attention of many programmers, mathematicians and developers because of the accuracy and speed with which it approximated inverse square roots (it had an error margin of about 1%). It is four times as fast as a regular inverse square root calculation, and is almost as fast, though not as accurate, as the current algorithm for approximating inverse square roots.\n" +

                    "id created a thriving licensing business on the back of its pioneering game engine, which also powered the developer’s highly successful multiplayer title – Quake III Arena. It may hence seem like id lacked any serious competition at that time, but that was not the case – it was challenged by a relative newcomer – Epic Games’ Unreal Tournament (1999). Epic’s multiplayer title was made with the Unreal Engine, which had first been used to create Unreal (1998), a first-person shooter that had proved successful. The engine itself surpassed id’s technology in key areas, especially graphics, and in the next section, we will discuss the rise of the Unreal Engine, and Unity, another industry standard engine."),

Minecraft’s multiplayer is distinctive in that it allows players to collaborate on mining for resources and working together to build increasingly complex and elaborate structures. While it has other multiplayer modes, Minecraft’s collaborative multiplayer was unlike any other style seen before – no game had ever enabled a mode where players just worked together to build incredible structures: there is no adversarial element involving combat in collaborative mode.

Dayz also features permadeath, meaning no matter how much loot and experience you have, you restart from scratch when you die.
